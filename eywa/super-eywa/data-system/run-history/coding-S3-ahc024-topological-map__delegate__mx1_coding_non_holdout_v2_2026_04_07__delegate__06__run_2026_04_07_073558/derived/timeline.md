# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S3-ahc024-topological-map
Title: S3. AHC024 / Topological Map

Problem:
# AHC024 / Topological Map

Write `main.py`.

You are given a `50 x 50` colored map.
Colors `1..M` must preserve their connectivity and all color-adjacency relations.
Color `0` represents empty cells.

## Objective

- Output a `50 x 50` grid using colors `0..M`.
- Every nonzero color must remain connected.
- Two colors must be adjacent in the output if and only if they were adjacent in the input.
- The score is `E + 1`, where `E` is the number of `0` cells in the final grid.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- The instance provides `N = 50`, `M`, and the original `50 x 50` color grid.

## Output

- Print `50` lines.
- Each line must contain `50` integers in `0..M`.
- The official tool accepts multiple candidate grids and scores the last one, but the simplest valid submission is one final `50 x 50` grid.

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
E + 1, where E is the number of empty cells.
Higher is better.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Analyze the input 50x50 grid to extract a graph where each node is a color (1 to M) and an edge exists between two nodes if their corresponding colors are adjacent in the input grid. Identify the adjacency list and the connectivity of each color component.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Given a graph of colors and their adjacency requirements, design an algorithm to place these colors on a 50x50 grid. Each color must occupy at least one cell, all cells of the same color must be connected, and two colors can only be adjacent if they have an edge in the graph. The goal is to minimize the number of cells used by colors to maximize the number of 0 cells.
