# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S4-ahc030-polyomino-mining
Title: S4. AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Problem:
# AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Write `main.py`.

This is an interactive-style optimization task.
You know the oil-field polyomino shapes but not their placements on the grid.
Your program must gather information and then report the oil cells.

## Objective

- Minimize probing cost while recovering the true oil configuration.
- Lower cost is better, and the official local tester converts that cost into the contest score.

## Input

- The initial input describes the grid size, the number of hidden oil fields, the noise parameter, and the set of polyomino shapes.

## Interaction Protocol

- Your program reads the initial problem instance from stdin.
- Then it writes commands to stdout and reads tester responses from stdin.
- Supported commands are:
  - `q 1 x y` for a single-cell drill query
  - `q k x1 y1 ... xk yk` for a multi-cell noisy aggregate query
  - `a k x1 y1 ... xk yk` to submit the final set of oil cells
- Flush after every command.

## Output Contract

- Because this packet uses the official local tester, your program should behave like a normal interactive solution.
- The tester captures the full command transcript and scores it.

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder tester and visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Lower probing cost is better.
Contest score is derived from absolute and relative cost.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 1 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Implement main.py for an interactive optimization task. 1. INPUT PARSING: Read initial grid parameters (width, height), number of hidden oil fields (N), noise parameter (P), and a list of polyomino shapes (sets of relative coordinates). 2. INTERACTION PROTOCOL: Use stdout for commands and stdin for responses. Commands: 'q 1 x y' (single-cell query), 'q k x1 y1 ... xk yk' (multi-cell aggregate query where k is the number of cells), 'a k x1 y1 ... xk yk' (final submission of k oil cells). After every command, flush stdout. Responses from stdin will provide the result of the query (e.g., presence of oil or noisy signal). 3. OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVE: Minimize the total probing cost (sum of costs associated with 'q' commands) while correctly identifying the exact set of cells belonging to the hidden polyominoes. 4. CONSTRAINTS: All coordinates (x, y) must be within grid boundaries. Output must contain only valid commands and no debug text, labels, or scores. The final command must be the 'a' command. 5. EXECUTION: Read from stdin, write to stdout, and ensure strict adherence to the command syntax.
