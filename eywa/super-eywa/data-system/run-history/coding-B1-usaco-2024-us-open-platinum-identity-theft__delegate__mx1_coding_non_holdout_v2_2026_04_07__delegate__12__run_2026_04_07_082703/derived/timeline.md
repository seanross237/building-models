# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-B1-usaco-2024-us-open-platinum-identity-theft
Title: B1. USACO 2024 US Open Platinum / Identity Theft

Problem:
# Identity Theft

Write `main.py`.

Farmer John has `N` cows, each with a bitstring ID.
Each cow may report any prefix of its final ID, including the full string.
If a reported prefix is the full final ID of a different cow, Bessie thinks identity theft happened.

You may append bits to the end of each original ID.
Appending one bit costs one second.
Find the minimum total number of appended bits needed so that no cow can ever be mistaken for another.

## Input

- Line 1: `N`
- Next `N` lines: the original bitstring IDs

## Output

- One integer: the minimum total appended-bit cost

## Constraints

- `1 <= N <= 10^5`
- Every ID is non-empty
- The total length of all IDs is at most `10^6`

## Notes

- This v1 packet grades only on bundled public samples.
- Source problem: USACO 2024 US Open Platinum, Problem 1.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Binary hidden-test acceptance.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Construct a Trie from the given N bitstrings. For each node in the Trie, track if it is an end-of-string node for one or more cows. Identify the structure of the Trie, specifically focusing on paths where an end-of-string node is an ancestor of other nodes or where multiple strings share a prefix that leads to multiple branches.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Given the Trie structure where some nodes are marked as 'terminal' (representing an original ID), determine the minimum number of bits to append to each terminal node such that no terminal node is a prefix of another. This can be modeled as: for every terminal node that has descendants in the Trie, we must extend that terminal node's ID with enough bits to move it to a unique leaf position that does not block other paths. Calculate the cost for each such node.
