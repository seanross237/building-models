# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S4-ahc030-polyomino-mining
Title: S4. AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Problem:
# AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Write `main.py`.

This is an interactive-style optimization task.
You know the oil-field polyomino shapes but not their placements on the grid.
Your program must gather information and then report the oil cells.

## Objective

- Minimize probing cost while recovering the true oil configuration.
- Lower cost is better, and the official local tester converts that cost into the contest score.

## Input

- The initial input describes the grid size, the number of hidden oil fields, the noise parameter, and the set of polyomino shapes.

## Interaction Protocol

- Your program reads the initial problem instance from stdin.
- Then it writes commands to stdout and reads tester responses from stdin.
- Supported commands are:
  - `q 1 x y` for a single-cell drill query
  - `q k x1 y1 ... xk yk` for a multi-cell noisy aggregate query
  - `a k x1 y1 ... xk yk` to submit the final set of oil cells
- Flush after every command.

## Output Contract

- Because this packet uses the official local tester, your program should behave like a normal interactive solution.
- The tester captures the full command transcript and scores it.

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder tester and visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Lower probing cost is better.
Contest score is derived from absolute and relative cost.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Design an optimal querying strategy to identify hidden polyominoes on a grid. Given a set of known polyomino shapes and a noise parameter, determine how to use single-cell queries (q 1 x y) and multi-cell aggregate queries (q k x1 y1 ...) to minimize total cost. Focus on how to use aggregate queries to detect presence/absence of oil in regions and how to refine locations using single-cell drills. Provide a mathematical approach for deciding when to switch from aggregate to single-cell queries based on the noise parameter and the known shapes.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Design the structure for a Python interactive program (main.py) that follows the specified protocol. The architecture must handle reading initial grid/shape data from stdin, managing a state of known/unknown cells, executing queries via stdout with flushing, and reading tester responses from stdin. Define the logic for the main loop that implements the strategy provided by the strategy designer, ensures the final answer is submitted using the 'a k x1 y1 ... xk yk' format, and strictly adheres to the requirement of not printing debug text or extra information to stdout.
