# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S3-ahc024-topological-map
Title: S3. AHC024 / Topological Map

Problem:
# AHC024 / Topological Map

Write `main.py`.

You are given a `50 x 50` colored map.
Colors `1..M` must preserve their connectivity and all color-adjacency relations.
Color `0` represents empty cells.

## Objective

- Output a `50 x 50` grid using colors `0..M`.
- Every nonzero color must remain connected.
- Two colors must be adjacent in the output if and only if they were adjacent in the input.
- The score is `E + 1`, where `E` is the number of `0` cells in the final grid.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- The instance provides `N = 50`, `M`, and the original `50 x 50` color grid.

## Output

- Print `50` lines.
- Each line must contain `50` integers in `0..M`.
- The official tool accepts multiple candidate grids and scores the last one, but the simplest valid submission is one final `50 x 50` grid.

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
E + 1, where E is the number of empty cells.
Higher is better.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Analyze the input 50x50 grid to extract two pieces of information: 1. A list of all unique non-zero colors present. 2. An adjacency list representing which colors are adjacent to each other in the input grid. Ensure that connectivity is verified for each color group.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Given a set of colors and their adjacency requirements, design a strategy to place these colors on a 50x50 grid using the minimum number of cells possible. The strategy must ensure that for every color, all its cells are connected (4-connectivity) and that two colors are adjacent in the grid if and only if they were adjacent in the input graph. Suggest a layout pattern, such as a snake-like path or a compact cluster, that minimizes the total number of non-zero cells used.
