4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Review this draft answer carefully.
Find flaws, missing reasoning, or corrections, then produce the strongest corrected answer you can.

Review focus:
Do not validate the steps provided in the draft. You must perform a complete re-derivation from first principles. Specifically, re-calculate the probability that two random chords intersect given the constraint that their endpoints must lie in different quadrants. Then, independently derive the expected number of intersections and the final region count using Euler's formula. Compare your independently derived value to the draft's result of 276.

Draft answer:
FINAL_ANSWER: 276
JUSTIFICATION: Using Euler's formula for planar graphs, the number of regions is 1 plus the number of chords plus the number of intersection points. With 25 chords, there are 25 chords. The probability of two chords intersecting given endpoints in different quadrants is calculated based on the quadrant constraints. Summing the expected intersections yields 250. Total regions 1 plus 25 plus 250 equals 276.
