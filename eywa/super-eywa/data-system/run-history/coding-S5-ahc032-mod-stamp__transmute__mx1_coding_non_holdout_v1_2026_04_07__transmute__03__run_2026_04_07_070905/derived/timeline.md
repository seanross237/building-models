# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S5-ahc032-mod-stamp
Title: S5. AHC032 / Mod Stamp

Problem:
# AHC032 / Mod Stamp

Write `main.py`.

You are given a `9 x 9` board of integers and `M = 20` different `3 x 3` stamps.
You may place at most `K = 81` stamps.

## Objective

- Each placement chooses a stamp index `m` and a top-left board position `(i, j)`.
- The chosen `3 x 3` stamp is added to the board modulo `998244353`.
- The score is the sum of all final board entries.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- Line 1: `N M K`
- Next `N` lines: the initial board
- Then for each stamp: `3` lines describing the stamp entries

## Output

- First line: `L`, the number of placements, with `0 <= L <= K`
- Then `L` lines of `m i j`
- `m` is the stamp index
- `(i, j)` is the top-left placement position, with the full `3 x 3` stamp inside the board

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Score is the sum of final cell values modulo 998244353.
Higher is better.

Packet baseline hint:
A fully valid baseline for this task is a program that prints exactly one line containing 0 and then exits. That means L = 0 placements, with no additional output lines.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 1 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Problem Specification: Mod Stamp Optimization

Objective:
Maximize the sum of all elements in an N x N grid after performing at most K stamp placements. All additions to the grid are performed modulo P, where P = 998244353. The final score is the sum of the values of all cells in the grid after all operations are completed.

Input Format:
- Line 1: Three integers N, M, and K.
  - N: The dimension of the square grid (N x N).
  - M: The number of available unique stamps.
  - K: The maximum number of stamp placements allowed.
- Next N lines: The initial N x N grid, where each entry is an integer.
- Following the grid: M blocks, each containing a 3 x 3 grid of integers representing a stamp.

Constraints:
- Grid size: N x N.
- Stamp size: 3 x 3.
- Number of stamps: M.
- Maximum placements: K.
- All cell updates: (current_value + stamp_value) mod 998244353.
- Placement rule: A stamp placement is defined by a stamp index m (0 <= m < M) and a top-left coordinate (i, j) such that the entire 3 x 3 stamp fits within the N x N grid (0 <= i <= N-3 and 0 <= j <= N-3).

Output Format:
- Line 1: An integer L, representing the number of placements performed (0 <= L <= K).
- Next L lines: Each line contains three space-separated integers 'm i j', where:
  - m: The index of the chosen stamp (0 <= m < M).
  - i: The row index of the top-left corner of the placement (0 <= i <= N-3).
  - j: The column index of the top-left corner of the placement (0 <= j <= N-3).
