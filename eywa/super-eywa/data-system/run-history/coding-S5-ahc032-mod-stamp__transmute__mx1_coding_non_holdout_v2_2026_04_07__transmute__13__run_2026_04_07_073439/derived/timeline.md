# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S5-ahc032-mod-stamp
Title: S5. AHC032 / Mod Stamp

Problem:
# AHC032 / Mod Stamp

Write `main.py`.

You are given a `9 x 9` board of integers and `M = 20` different `3 x 3` stamps.
You may place at most `K = 81` stamps.

## Objective

- Each placement chooses a stamp index `m` and a top-left board position `(i, j)`.
- The chosen `3 x 3` stamp is added to the board modulo `998244353`.
- The score is the sum of all final board entries.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- Line 1: `N M K`
- Next `N` lines: the initial board
- Then for each stamp: `3` lines describing the stamp entries

## Output

- First line: `L`, the number of placements, with `0 <= L <= K`
- Then `L` lines of `m i j`
- `m` is the stamp index
- `(i, j)` is the top-left placement position, with the full `3 x 3` stamp inside the board

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Score is the sum of final cell values modulo 998244353.
Higher is better.

Packet baseline hint:
A fully valid baseline for this task is a program that prints exactly one line containing 0 and then exits. That means L = 0 placements, with no additional output lines.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 1 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Task: Optimize stamp placement on a grid to maximize the sum of board entries. 

Input Specification:
- N M K: Grid dimension (N=9), number of available stamps (M=20), maximum placements (K=81).
- Initial Board: N x N matrix of integers.
- Stamps: M sets of 3 x 3 matrices.

Constraints:
- Grid Size: 9 x 9.
- Stamp Size: 3 x 3.
- Max Placements: K = 81.
- Placement Rule: A placement (m, i, j) adds stamp m to the board starting at top-left coordinate (i, j). All indices (i, j) must ensure the 3x3 stamp is fully contained within the 9x9 grid (0 <= i, j <= 6).
- Arithmetic: All additions are performed modulo 998244353.

Objective:
- Maximize Score = Sum of all elements in the final N x N board.

Output Specification:
- Line 1: L (number of placements, 0 <= L <= K).
- Next L lines: 'm i j' (stamp index m, top-left row i, top-left column j).

Implementation Requirements:
- Language: Python (main.py).
- I/O: Read from stdin, write to stdout.
- No debug text, labels, or extra output allowed.
