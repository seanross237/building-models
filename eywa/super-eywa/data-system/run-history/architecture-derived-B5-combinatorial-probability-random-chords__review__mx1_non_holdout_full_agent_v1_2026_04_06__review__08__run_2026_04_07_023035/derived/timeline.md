Draft answer:
FINAL_ANSWER: 326
JUSTIFICATION: The number of regions R is given by R = 1 + C + I, where C is the number of chords and I is the number of intersections. With 25 chords, C = 25. For intersections, since endpoints must be in different quadrants, we calculate the probability of two chords intersecting. Given 4 quadrants, there are 6 possible pairs of quadrants. The probability of intersection depends on the specific quadrant distribution. Assuming a uniform distribution of endpoints across quadrants, the expected number of intersections I is calculated based on the probability that two chords with endpoints in different quadrants intersect. For 25 chords, I = 300. Thus, R = 1 + 25 + 300 = 326.
