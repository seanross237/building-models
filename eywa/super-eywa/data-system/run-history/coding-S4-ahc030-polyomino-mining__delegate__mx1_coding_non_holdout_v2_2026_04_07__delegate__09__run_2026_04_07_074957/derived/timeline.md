# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S4-ahc030-polyomino-mining
Title: S4. AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Problem:
# AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Write `main.py`.

This is an interactive-style optimization task.
You know the oil-field polyomino shapes but not their placements on the grid.
Your program must gather information and then report the oil cells.

## Objective

- Minimize probing cost while recovering the true oil configuration.
- Lower cost is better, and the official local tester converts that cost into the contest score.

## Input

- The initial input describes the grid size, the number of hidden oil fields, the noise parameter, and the set of polyomino shapes.

## Interaction Protocol

- Your program reads the initial problem instance from stdin.
- Then it writes commands to stdout and reads tester responses from stdin.
- Supported commands are:
  - `q 1 x y` for a single-cell drill query
  - `q k x1 y1 ... xk yk` for a multi-cell noisy aggregate query
  - `a k x1 y1 ... xk yk` to submit the final set of oil cells
- Flush after every command.

## Output Contract

- Because this packet uses the official local tester, your program should behave like a normal interactive solution.
- The tester captures the full command transcript and scores it.

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder tester and visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Lower probing cost is better.
Contest score is derived from absolute and relative cost.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Implement the interactive communication loop in Python. Create a class that reads the initial grid dimensions, number of oil fields, noise parameter, and polyomino shapes from stdin. Implement methods to send single-cell queries using the q 1 x y format, multi-cell aggregate queries using the q k x1 y1 ... xk yk format, and the final answer submission using the a k x1 y1 ... xk yk format. Ensure all stdout writes are followed by a flush. The handler should return the parsed responses from the tester for each query.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Implement the core logic to identify the hidden polyominoes. Given the set of possible polyomino shapes and the noisy feedback from the I/O handler, develop a strategy to minimize probing costs. This should involve a search or probabilistic model to estimate the most likely locations and orientations of the oil fields. The engine should decide which coordinates to query next based on information gain or cost-efficiency and finally output the most probable set of oil cells. Focus on handling the noise parameter provided in the initial input.
