# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S1-ahc001-atcoder-ad
Title: S1. AHC001 / AtCoder Ad

Problem:
# AHC001 / AtCoder Ad

Write `main.py`.

You are given `N` advertisers.
Advertiser `i` requests a point `(x_i, y_i)` and a target area `r_i` inside a `10000 x 10000` square.
Output one axis-aligned rectangle for each advertiser.

## Objective

- Every rectangle must stay inside the board.
- Rectangle `i` must contain its requested point `(x_i, y_i)`.
- Rectangles must not overlap.
- The score rewards making each rectangle area close to `r_i`.

## Input

- Line 1: `N`
- Next `N` lines: `x_i y_i r_i`

## Output

- Print exactly `N` lines.
- Line `i` must be `x1 y1 x2 y2` for advertiser `i`.
- The rectangle is `[x1, x2) x [y1, y2)`.

## Notes

- A rectangle with invalid bounds or one that misses its required point receives no benefit.
- Overlapping rectangles make the score collapse to zero.
- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Continuous score from advertiser satisfaction.
Higher is better.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Propose a geometric algorithm to partition a 10000x10000 square into N non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles such that each rectangle i contains the point (x_i, y_i). Consider using a k-d tree approach or a recursive binary space partitioning (BSP) method where splits are chosen to keep the requested points within the resulting cells. Suggest how to adjust the final rectangle dimensions within each cell to approximate the target area r_i without overlapping or leaving the board.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Write a complete main.py script based on a spatial partitioning strategy (like a k-d tree). The script must: 1. Read N and the N lines of x, y, r. 2. Implement a recursive function that splits the current bounding box into two using either a vertical or horizontal line that separates the points into two sets. 3. Once the space is partitioned into N cells, for each cell, calculate the largest possible rectangle that contains its assigned (x_i, y_i) and stays within the cell boundaries, attempting to match the area r_i. 4. Ensure no rectangles overlap and all are within [0, 10000). 5. Print the results in the format x1 y1 x2 y2.
