# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-B2-usaco-2023-us-open-gold-tree-merging
Title: B2. USACO 2023 US Open Gold / Tree Merging

Problem:
# Tree Merging

Write `main.py`.

You are given an initial rooted tree and a final rooted tree.
The initial tree has node values `1..N`, and the final tree uses values drawn from the same set.

One operation may merge two distinct sibling nodes.
The merged node keeps the larger value of the two nodes, and its children become the union of both child sets.

For each test case, output any valid sequence of merging operations that transforms the initial tree into the final tree.
It is guaranteed that at least one valid sequence exists.

## Input

- Line 1: `T`, the number of test cases
- For each test case:
  - Line: `N`
  - Next `N-1` lines: `v p` describing an edge in the initial tree
  - Line: `M`
  - Next `M-1` lines: `v p` describing an edge in the final tree

## Output

For each test case:

- One line with the number of merge operations
- Then that many lines, each with two node values to merge

Any valid sequence is accepted.

## Constraints

- `1 <= T <= 100`
- Sum of all `N` across test cases is at most `1000`

## Notes

- This v1 packet grades only on bundled public samples.
- Source problem: USACO 2023 US Open Gold, Problem 3.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Binary hidden-test acceptance.
