4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Review this draft answer carefully.
Find flaws, missing reasoning, or corrections, then produce the strongest corrected answer you can.

Review focus:
Treat this as a self-consistent mean-field calculation. Ensure occupancy is solved as a fixed point of n = f(n) rather than a single-particle problem.

JUSTIFICATION: <brief justification>

Draft answer:
FINAL_ANSWER: 0.52
JUSTIFICATION: The occupancy was determined by solving the self-consistent equation n = 1 / (1 + exp((epsilon - mu)/kT)) where epsilon depends on n.
