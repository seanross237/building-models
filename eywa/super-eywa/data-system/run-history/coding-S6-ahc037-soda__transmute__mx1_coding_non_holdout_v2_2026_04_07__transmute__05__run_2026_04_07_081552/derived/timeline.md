# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S6-ahc037-soda
Title: S6. AHC037 / Soda

Problem:
# AHC037 / Soda

Write `main.py`.

You start with the beverage `(0, 0)`.
The input gives `N = 1000` target beverages `(a_i, b_i)`.
Each operation creates a new beverage from an existing one by increasing sweetness and carbonation.

## Objective

- Every target beverage must eventually be created.
- If an operation creates `(tx, ty)` from `(fx, fy)`, then `tx >= fx` and `ty >= fy`.
- The cost of that operation is `(tx - fx) + (ty - fy)`.
- The official score is `round(10^6 * N * L / (1 + C))`, where `C` is total cost and `L` is the maximum coordinate scale in the instance.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- Line 1: `N`
- Next `N` lines: `a_i b_i`

## Output

- First line: `m`, the number of operations
- Then `m` lines of `from_x from_y to_x to_y`

## Notes

- The sequence must be valid in order: each source beverage must already exist when it is used.
- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
round(10^6 * NL / (1 + C)), where C is total cost and L is the max coordinate scale.
Higher is better.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 1 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Problem Class: Combinatorial Optimization / Minimum Cost Directed Steiner Tree variation on a 2D grid.

Core Mathematical Optimization Goal: Minimize the total cost C, where C is the sum of Manhattan distances of all operations performed. The cost of an operation from (fx, fy) to (tx, ty) is (tx - fx) + (ty - fy). The objective is to maximize a score inversely proportional to (1 + C).

Underlying Structure: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes are coordinate pairs (x, y). The graph must start with the root node (0, 0). Every target node (a_i, b_i) must be reachable from the root through a sequence of operations. Each operation (edge) must satisfy the monotonicity constraint: tx >= fx and ty >= fy.

Constraints and State-Transition Rules:
1. Initial State: The set of existing beverages contains only {(0, 0)}.
2. Target Set: A set of N target coordinates {(a_i, b_i)} must be included in the set of existing beverages.
3. Operation Rule: An operation transforms an existing beverage (fx, fy) into a new beverage (tx, ty) such that tx >= fx and ty >= fy.
4. Validity: An operation can only be performed if (fx, fy) is already in the set of existing beverages.
5. Cost: Each operation adds (tx - fx) + (ty - fy) to the total cost C.

Input Requirements:
- An integer N representing the number of target beverages.
- N pairs of integers (a_i, b_i) representing the target coordinates.

Output Requirements:
- An integer m representing the total number of operations.
- m lines, each containing four integers: from_x, from_y, to_x, to_y, representing the source and destination of each operation.
