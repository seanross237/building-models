3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Identify the smallest prime p such that the congruence n^4 + 1 is congruent to 0 modulo p. For each candidate p, check if the derivative 4n^3 is non-zero modulo p. If it is, use Hensel's Lemma to determine if there exists a solution to n^4 + 1 is congruent to 0 modulo p^2. List the smallest such p and the corresponding n modulo p^2.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Given the prime p found by the previous helper, find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is congruent to 0 modulo p^2. Note that m must be one of the roots found in the previous step.
