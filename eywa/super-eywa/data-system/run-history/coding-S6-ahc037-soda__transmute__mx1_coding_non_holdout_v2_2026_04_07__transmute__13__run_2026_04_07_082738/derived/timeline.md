# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S6-ahc037-soda
Title: S6. AHC037 / Soda

Problem:
# AHC037 / Soda

Write `main.py`.

You start with the beverage `(0, 0)`.
The input gives `N = 1000` target beverages `(a_i, b_i)`.
Each operation creates a new beverage from an existing one by increasing sweetness and carbonation.

## Objective

- Every target beverage must eventually be created.
- If an operation creates `(tx, ty)` from `(fx, fy)`, then `tx >= fx` and `ty >= fy`.
- The cost of that operation is `(tx - fx) + (ty - fy)`.
- The official score is `round(10^6 * N * L / (1 + C))`, where `C` is total cost and `L` is the maximum coordinate scale in the instance.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- Line 1: `N`
- Next `N` lines: `a_i b_i`

## Output

- First line: `m`, the number of operations
- Then `m` lines of `from_x from_y to_x to_y`

## Notes

- The sequence must be valid in order: each source beverage must already exist when it is used.
- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
round(10^6 * NL / (1 + C)), where C is total cost and L is the max coordinate scale.
Higher is better.

4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Problem Class: Minimum Spanning Tree / Steiner Tree variant on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with Manhattan distance costs. Mathematical Objective: Minimize the total cost C, where C is the sum of Manhattan distances of all operations used to reach all N target nodes from the root node (0,0). The objective function to maximize is 10^6 * N * L / (1 + C), which is equivalent to minimizing C. Combinatorial Structure: The problem is modeled as finding a directed tree (specifically an arborescence) rooted at (0,0) that spans all N target points (a_i, b_i). The edges must satisfy a monotonicity constraint: for any edge from (fx, fy) to (tx, ty), it must hold that tx >= fx and ty >= fy. State-Transition Rules and Constraints: 1. Initial State: A set of existing nodes S = {(0,0)}. 2. Transition: An operation (fx, fy) -> (tx, ty) is valid if (fx, fy) is in S and tx >= fx and ty >= fy. 3. Post-condition: After transition, (tx, ty) is added to S. 4. Termination: The process terminates when all N target nodes are elements of S. 5. Cost Function: The cost of a single transition is (tx - fx) + (ty - fy). 6. Validity Requirement: The sequence of operations must be topologically sorted such that the source node of any operation is a node created by a previous operation or the initial node. Input Protocol: - Integer N: Number of target nodes. - N pairs of integers (a_i, b_i): Coordinates of target nodes. Output Protocol: - Integer m: Total number of operations performed. - m lines of four integers: from_x from_y to_x to_y. Critical Properties for Optimization: The problem is a variation of the Minimum Spanning Tree problem in a 2D plane under Manhattan distance, constrained by a partial order (monotonicity). An optimal solution seeks to reuse existing nodes as sources for new nodes to minimize the total Manhattan distance. A greedy approach or a Steiner-tree-like heuristic that connects target nodes to their nearest existing neighbors in the quadrant (x >= fx, y >= fy) is recommended.
