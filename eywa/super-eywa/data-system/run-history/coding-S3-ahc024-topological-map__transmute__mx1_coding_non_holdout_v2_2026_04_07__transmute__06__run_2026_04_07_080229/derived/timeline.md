# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S3-ahc024-topological-map
Title: S3. AHC024 / Topological Map

Problem:
# AHC024 / Topological Map

Write `main.py`.

You are given a `50 x 50` colored map.
Colors `1..M` must preserve their connectivity and all color-adjacency relations.
Color `0` represents empty cells.

## Objective

- Output a `50 x 50` grid using colors `0..M`.
- Every nonzero color must remain connected.
- Two colors must be adjacent in the output if and only if they were adjacent in the input.
- The score is `E + 1`, where `E` is the number of `0` cells in the final grid.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- The instance provides `N = 50`, `M`, and the original `50 x 50` color grid.

## Output

- Print `50` lines.
- Each line must contain `50` integers in `0..M`.
- The official tool accepts multiple candidate grids and scores the last one, but the simplest valid submission is one final `50 x 50` grid.

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
E + 1, where E is the number of empty cells.
Higher is better.

4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Problem Specification: Topological Map Reconstruction

Input:
- N: Grid dimension (N = 50).
- M: Maximum color index.
- Input Grid: An N x N matrix where each cell contains a value in {0, 1, ..., M}.

Output:
- An N x N matrix where each cell contains a value in {0, 1, ..., M}.

Constraints:
1. Connectivity Invariant: For every color c in {1, ..., M}, the set of cells {(r, c) | Grid[r][c] == c} must form a single connected component in the output grid. Connectivity is defined by 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right).
2. Adjacency Invariant: Let A be the set of color pairs (c1, c2) such that c1, c2 in {1, ..., M}, c1 != c2, and there exist cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) in the input grid that are 4-adjacent and have colors c1 and c2 respectively. In the output grid, two colors c1 and c2 must be 4-adjacent if and only if (c1, c2) is in A.
3. Domain Constraint: All output cell values must be in the range [0, M].

Optimization Objective:
- Maximize E + 1, where E is the count of cells in the output grid with value 0.
- This is equivalent to minimizing the total number of non-zero cells used to satisfy the connectivity and adjacency invariants.
