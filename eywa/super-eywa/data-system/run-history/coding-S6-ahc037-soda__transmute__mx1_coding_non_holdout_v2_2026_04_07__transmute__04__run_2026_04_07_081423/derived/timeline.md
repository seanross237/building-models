# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S6-ahc037-soda
Title: S6. AHC037 / Soda

Problem:
# AHC037 / Soda

Write `main.py`.

You start with the beverage `(0, 0)`.
The input gives `N = 1000` target beverages `(a_i, b_i)`.
Each operation creates a new beverage from an existing one by increasing sweetness and carbonation.

## Objective

- Every target beverage must eventually be created.
- If an operation creates `(tx, ty)` from `(fx, fy)`, then `tx >= fx` and `ty >= fy`.
- The cost of that operation is `(tx - fx) + (ty - fy)`.
- The official score is `round(10^6 * N * L / (1 + C))`, where `C` is total cost and `L` is the maximum coordinate scale in the instance.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- Line 1: `N`
- Next `N` lines: `a_i b_i`

## Output

- First line: `m`, the number of operations
- Then `m` lines of `from_x from_y to_x to_y`

## Notes

- The sequence must be valid in order: each source beverage must already exist when it is used.
- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
round(10^6 * NL / (1 + C)), where C is total cost and L is the max coordinate scale.
Higher is better.

4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Problem Type: Minimum Cost Directed Steiner Tree / Minimum Cost Arborescence on a 2D Grid with Monotonicity Constraints.

Objective: Minimize the total cost C, where C is the sum of Manhattan distances of all operations used to reach all N target points from an initial starting point (0, 0). The score is maximized when C is minimized.

Mathematical Structure: Given a set of N points S = {(a_1, b_1), ..., (a_N, b_N)} and a root point R = (0, 0), construct a directed tree (or forest rooted at R) such that for every edge from (fx, fy) to (tx, ty), the conditions tx >= fx and ty >= fy are satisfied. The cost of an edge is (tx - fx) + (ty - fy).

Constraints and Rules:
1. Every target point (a_i, b_i) must be a node in the constructed tree.
2. For every operation (fx, fy) -> (tx, ty), the source (fx, fy) must have been previously created (either as the root or as a result of a prior operation).
3. Monotonicity: tx >= fx and ty >= fy for all edges.
4. The total cost C is the sum of (tx - fx) + (ty - fy) over all m operations.

Input Requirements:
- Integer N: Number of target points.
- N pairs of integers (a_i, b_i): Target coordinates.

Output Requirements:
- Integer m: Total number of operations.
- m lines, each containing: from_x from_y to_x to_y.

Optimization Strategy: This is equivalent to finding a minimum cost set of edges that connects all points to the origin under the monotonicity constraint. Since the cost is the Manhattan distance, the problem can be viewed as finding a path or tree structure that minimizes the total distance traveled. A greedy approach or a nearest-neighbor approach considering the monotonicity constraint (finding a point (fx, fy) such that fx <= tx and fy <= ty that minimizes (tx-fx) + (ty-fy)) is a viable baseline. More advanced approaches might involve dynamic programming or Steiner tree heuristics.
