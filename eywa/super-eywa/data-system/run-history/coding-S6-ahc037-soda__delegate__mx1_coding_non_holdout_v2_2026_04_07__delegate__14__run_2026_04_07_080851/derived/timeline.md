# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S6-ahc037-soda
Title: S6. AHC037 / Soda

Problem:
# AHC037 / Soda

Write `main.py`.

You start with the beverage `(0, 0)`.
The input gives `N = 1000` target beverages `(a_i, b_i)`.
Each operation creates a new beverage from an existing one by increasing sweetness and carbonation.

## Objective

- Every target beverage must eventually be created.
- If an operation creates `(tx, ty)` from `(fx, fy)`, then `tx >= fx` and `ty >= fy`.
- The cost of that operation is `(tx - fx) + (ty - fy)`.
- The official score is `round(10^6 * N * L / (1 + C))`, where `C` is total cost and `L` is the maximum coordinate scale in the instance.
- Higher is better.

## Input

- Line 1: `N`
- Next `N` lines: `a_i b_i`

## Output

- First line: `m`, the number of operations
- Then `m` lines of `from_x from_y to_x to_y`

## Notes

- The sequence must be valid in order: each source beverage must already exist when it is used.
- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
round(10^6 * NL / (1 + C)), where C is total cost and L is the max coordinate scale.
Higher is better.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Propose a greedy or heuristic strategy to minimize the total Manhattan distance cost C while ensuring all target points (ai, bi) are reachable from (0,0) via a sequence of valid operations. Consider sorting points by their coordinates (e.g., by x then y) or using a nearest-neighbor approach that respects the tx >= fx and ty >= fy constraint. Evaluate if a simple approach like connecting each point to the closest already-created point that satisfies the monotonicity constraint is sufficient.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Design the structure of the main.py script. The script must read N and the N pairs of coordinates. It needs to maintain a set of 'available' beverages, starting with (0,0). It must iteratively select a target beverage not yet created, find a valid source beverage from the available set that minimizes the cost (tx - fx) + (ty - fy), record the operation, and add the new beverage to the available set. Finally, it must output the total number of operations followed by the operations in the specified format.
