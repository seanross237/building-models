4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Review this draft answer carefully.
Find flaws, missing reasoning, or corrections, then produce the strongest corrected answer you can.

Review focus:
Analyze the mathematical derivation for the expected number of intersections. Specifically, verify if the probability of intersection for two chords with endpoints in different quadrants is indeed 1/3 and check the application of Euler's formula for regions in a circle.

Draft answer:
FINAL_ANSWER: 301
JUSTIFICATION: Using Euler's formula for planar graphs, regions = 1 + chords + intersections. With 25 chords, intersections occur when endpoints alternate in order. Since endpoints must be in different quadrants, the probability of two chords intersecting is 1/3. Expected intersections = (25 * 24 / 2) * (1/3) = 100. Total regions = 1 + 25 + 100 = 126.
