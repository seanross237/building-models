# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-B2-usaco-2023-us-open-gold-tree-merging
Title: B2. USACO 2023 US Open Gold / Tree Merging

Problem:
# Tree Merging

Write `main.py`.

You are given an initial rooted tree and a final rooted tree.
The initial tree has node values `1..N`, and the final tree uses values drawn from the same set.

One operation may merge two distinct sibling nodes.
The merged node keeps the larger value of the two nodes, and its children become the union of both child sets.

For each test case, output any valid sequence of merging operations that transforms the initial tree into the final tree.
It is guaranteed that at least one valid sequence exists.

## Input

- Line 1: `T`, the number of test cases
- For each test case:
  - Line: `N`
  - Next `N-1` lines: `v p` describing an edge in the initial tree
  - Line: `M`
  - Next `M-1` lines: `v p` describing an edge in the final tree

## Output

For each test case:

- One line with the number of merge operations
- Then that many lines, each with two node values to merge

Any valid sequence is accepted.

## Constraints

- `1 <= T <= 100`
- Sum of all `N` across test cases is at most `1000`

## Notes

- This v1 packet grades only on bundled public samples.
- Source problem: USACO 2023 US Open Gold, Problem 3.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Binary hidden-test acceptance.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Analyze the relationship between the initial tree and the final tree. For each node in the final tree, identify which node (or set of nodes) in the initial tree corresponds to it. Specifically, determine which siblings in the initial tree must be merged to form a single node in the final tree. A node in the final tree is formed by merging a set of siblings in the initial tree if they all share the same parent and the largest value among them matches the final node's value.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Given the mapping of initial sibling sets that must be merged to form final nodes, generate a valid sequence of merge operations. A merge operation (u, v) is valid if u and v are siblings. To ensure the 'larger value survives' rule is respected and to avoid invalid states, suggest a bottom-up approach: merge siblings at the deepest possible level first. For a set of siblings that need to be merged into one, order the merges such that we always merge a smaller value into a larger value, or ensure the sequence of merges results in the correct final set of children for the parent.
