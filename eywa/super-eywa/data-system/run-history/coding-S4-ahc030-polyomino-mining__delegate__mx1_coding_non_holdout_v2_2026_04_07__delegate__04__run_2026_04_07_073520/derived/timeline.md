# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S4-ahc030-polyomino-mining
Title: S4. AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Problem:
# AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Write `main.py`.

This is an interactive-style optimization task.
You know the oil-field polyomino shapes but not their placements on the grid.
Your program must gather information and then report the oil cells.

## Objective

- Minimize probing cost while recovering the true oil configuration.
- Lower cost is better, and the official local tester converts that cost into the contest score.

## Input

- The initial input describes the grid size, the number of hidden oil fields, the noise parameter, and the set of polyomino shapes.

## Interaction Protocol

- Your program reads the initial problem instance from stdin.
- Then it writes commands to stdout and reads tester responses from stdin.
- Supported commands are:
  - `q 1 x y` for a single-cell drill query
  - `q k x1 y1 ... xk yk` for a multi-cell noisy aggregate query
  - `a k x1 y1 ... xk yk` to submit the final set of oil cells
- Flush after every command.

## Output Contract

- Because this packet uses the official local tester, your program should behave like a normal interactive solution.
- The tester captures the full command transcript and scores it.

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder tester and visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Lower probing cost is better.
Contest score is derived from absolute and relative cost.

3. [node_root] Node recruited 2 helper(s)
4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Design an optimal probing strategy for the Polyomino Mining problem. The goal is to identify the locations of hidden polyomino shapes on a grid while minimizing the cost of queries. Consider the difference between single-cell queries (q 1) and multi-cell noisy aggregate queries (q k). Propose a method to use aggregate queries to narrow down potential locations of polyominoes and a method to verify them. The strategy should account for the fact that shapes are known but positions are not. Suggest a sequence of steps: initial coarse-grained sampling, refinement of candidate regions, and final verification.
5. [node_root_helper_01] Node completed with action report_success
6. [node_root_helper_02] Node started: Implement the main.py script based on the provided problem description and the strategy provided by the strategy_designer. The script must: 1. Read the initial grid size, number of oil fields, noise parameter, and polyomino shapes from stdin. 2. Implement an interactive loop that uses stdout to send queries (q 1 or q k) and reads responses from stdin. 3. Use the strategy to decide which cells or groups of cells to query. 4. Finally, output the identified oil cells using the 'a k x1 y1 ... xk yk' format. Ensure the code handles standard input/output correctly, flushes stdout after every command, and follows the strict output contract. Use a robust baseline approach if the strategy is complex.
