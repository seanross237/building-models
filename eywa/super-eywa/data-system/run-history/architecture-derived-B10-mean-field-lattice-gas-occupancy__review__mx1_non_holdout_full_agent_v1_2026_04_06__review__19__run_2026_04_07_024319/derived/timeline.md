JUSTIFICATION: <brief justification>

Draft answer:
FINAL_ANSWER: 0.114
JUSTIFICATION: The occupancy n is solved using the self-consistent equation n = 1 / (1 + exp((epsilon - mu) / (k_B T))) where epsilon = z_h * e * n + z_v * e * n. Substituting the given values results in n = 1 / (1 + exp((12 * (-0.15915 * n) - 0.1) / 1)). Solving n = 1 / (1 + exp(-1.9098 * n - 0.1)) yields n approximately 0.114.
