4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Review this draft answer carefully.
Find flaws, missing reasoning, or corrections, then produce the strongest corrected answer you can.

Review focus:
Please validate the derivation of the expected number of intersections E[I] for 25 chords under the constraint that endpoints must lie in different quadrants, and verify the final application of the formula R = 1 + N + E[I].

Draft answer:
FINAL_ANSWER: 276
JUSTIFICATION: Use Euler's formula for planar graphs (V - E + F = 2) or the formula for regions in a circle: R = 1 + N + I, where N is the number of chords and I is the number of intersection points. For N = 25 chords, R = 1 + 25 + E[I]. The expected number of intersections E[I] is calculated by summing the probability that any two chords intersect. Given endpoints must be in different quadrants, we calculate the probability of intersection for pairs of chords based on the quadrant distribution.
