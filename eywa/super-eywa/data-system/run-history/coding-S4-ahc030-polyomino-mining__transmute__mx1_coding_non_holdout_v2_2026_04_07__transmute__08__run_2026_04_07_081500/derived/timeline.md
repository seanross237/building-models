# Run Timeline

1. [node_root] Run started for task: Solve this Super-Eywa coding benchmark.
Question ID: coding-S4-ahc030-polyomino-mining
Title: S4. AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Problem:
# AHC030 / Polyomino Mining

Write `main.py`.

This is an interactive-style optimization task.
You know the oil-field polyomino shapes but not their placements on the grid.
Your program must gather information and then report the oil cells.

## Objective

- Minimize probing cost while recovering the true oil configuration.
- Lower cost is better, and the official local tester converts that cost into the contest score.

## Input

- The initial input describes the grid size, the number of hidden oil fields, the noise parameter, and the set of polyomino shapes.

## Interaction Protocol

- Your program reads the initial problem instance from stdin.
- Then it writes commands to stdout and reads tester responses from stdin.
- Supported commands are:
  - `q 1 x y` for a single-cell drill query
  - `q k x1 y1 ... xk yk` for a multi-cell noisy aggregate query
  - `a k x1 y1 ... xk yk` to submit the final set of oil cells
- Flush after every command.

## Output Contract

- Because this packet uses the official local tester, your program should behave like a normal interactive solution.
- The tester captures the full command transcript and scores it.

## Notes

- This v1 packet uses the official AtCoder tester and visualizer on three bundled public instances.

Submission contract:
- Return a single Python submission file named main.py.
- Read from stdin and write to stdout.
- Put the full file content in the artifacts list of your execute_locally JSON response.
- Use the response field only for a brief submission summary.
- Do not wrap the code in markdown fences inside artifacts.

Critical validity rules:
- Your program is judged by the stdout it prints when run, not by the summary in your JSON response.
- Print exactly the contestant output described in the Output section, and nothing else.
- Do not print the objective score, estimated score, labels, explanations, or debug text unless the Output section explicitly requires them.
- If the Output section requires a count/header on the first line, print that first line exactly.
- Every printed index, count, and coordinate must stay within the allowed ranges.
- Prefer a simple valid baseline solution over an ambitious but invalid one.
- If the problem permits an empty or minimal valid plan, that is better than malformed output.

Grading target:
Lower probing cost is better.
Contest score is derived from absolute and relative cost.

1. INTERACTION LOOP
- Initialization: Read grid dimensions, number of hidden polyominoes, noise parameter, and the set of available polyomino shapes from stdin.
- Query Phase: Perform iterative queries to locate oil cells using two command types:
  - Single-cell drill: Output 'q 1 x y' where x and y are coordinates. Read response from stdin.
  - Multi-cell aggregate: Output 'q k x1 y1 ... xk yk' where k is the number of cells and coordinates follow. Read response from stdin.
- Submission Phase: Output 'a k x1 y1 ... xk yk' where k is the total number of identified oil cells and coordinates follow. This terminates the interaction.
- Requirement: Flush stdout after every command.

2. OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVE
- Primary Goal: Identify the exact set of coordinates belonging to the hidden polyominoes.
- Cost Function: Minimize the cumulative cost of all 'q' commands issued. The agent must balance the high information gain of multi-cell queries against the potential for noise and the cost-per-cell ratio to maximize accuracy while minimizing total expenditure.

3. ALGORITHMIC CONSTRAINTS
- Spatial Pattern Matching: The agent must reconstruct specific polyomino shapes from discrete, potentially noisy probe results.
- Noise Management: The agent must account for a noise parameter that affects the reliability of aggregate queries, requiring strategies to distinguish true oil cells from noise-induced false positives.
- Search Efficiency: The agent must navigate a large grid to find a limited number of hidden shapes without exhaustive probing.

4. EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
- File Name: main.py
- I/O Handling: Use standard stdin for input and stdout for all commands and the final answer.
- Output Strictness: Do not print debug information, scores, or explanations. The stdout must contain only the valid command sequence and the final answer. Any non-essential text will result in a failure.
