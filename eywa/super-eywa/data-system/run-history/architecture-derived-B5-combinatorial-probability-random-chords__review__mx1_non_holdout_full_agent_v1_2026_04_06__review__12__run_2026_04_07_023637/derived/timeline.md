4. [node_root_helper_01] Node started: Review this draft answer carefully.
Find flaws, missing reasoning, or corrections, then produce the strongest corrected answer you can.

Review focus:
Please verify the expected number of intersections using a first-principles approach. Test the logic against a simplified version of the problem, such as 2 or 3 chords, to ensure the intersection probability and the formula for regions are applied correctly.

Draft answer:
FINAL_ANSWER: 301
JUSTIFICATION: The number of regions R is given by 1 + n + I, where n is the number of chords and I is the number of intersections. With n = 25, we calculate the expected number of intersections E[I]. Since endpoints must be in different quadrants, we calculate the probability of two chords intersecting based on the quadrant distribution. For 25 chords, the expected number of intersections is 275, leading to 1 + 25 + 275 = 301.
