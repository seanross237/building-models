# Tree Merging

Write `main.py`.

You are given an initial rooted tree and a final rooted tree.
The initial tree has node values `1..N`, and the final tree uses values drawn from the same set.

One operation may merge two distinct sibling nodes.
The merged node keeps the larger value of the two nodes, and its children become the union of both child sets.

For each test case, output any valid sequence of merging operations that transforms the initial tree into the final tree.
It is guaranteed that at least one valid sequence exists.

## Input

- Line 1: `T`, the number of test cases
- For each test case:
  - Line: `N`
  - Next `N-1` lines: `v p` describing an edge in the initial tree
  - Line: `M`
  - Next `M-1` lines: `v p` describing an edge in the final tree

## Output

For each test case:

- One line with the number of merge operations
- Then that many lines, each with two node values to merge

Any valid sequence is accepted.

## Constraints

- `1 <= T <= 100`
- Sum of all `N` across test cases is at most `1000`
